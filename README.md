The system will allow people to query information about one or more addresses.

The system will store the following information for an address/parcel:

* Identifiers that other systems use to identify the address/parcel, KIVA PIN, County APN
* Attributes of an address/parcel such as Census Tract, City Council District ...
* Data about an address/parcel, amount paid in taxes, ...

It is intended to answer the following:

* Get a normalized standard address, for example "210 W 19th Ter, Kansas City, MO" 
standard address might be 
"210 West 19th Terrace, Kansas City, MO, 64108"
* Return selected identifiers, attributes, and data related to one or more address.
This will allow for other 
* Get a list of addresses within a radius of a coordinate or other boundary.


In addition with the data we collect for the above we can return other information such as:

* All addresses in a census tract
* Census tracts that are in a neighborhood
